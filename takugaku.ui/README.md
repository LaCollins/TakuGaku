## Description
TakuGaku is a homeschool support application that allows homeschooling families to build schedules, assign and grade homework, and generate report cards.
TakuGaku allows students to log in and view their personal schedules, mark assignments as complete, and view their grades.

I was inspired to build this application as many families are being forced to home school due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As someone who was homeschooled for my primary school years and later attended public school for high school, I felt that I had a unique insight into the troubles that families that are new to home schooling may face. I felt that students who are used to the routine structure of public school may have a difficult time transitioning if they are faced with too much change. With TakuGaku, it is easy to build a school schedule that is similar to a public school routine, as well as track assignments and grades. My hope is that such an application would make home schooling easier to manage.


### What's in store for the future of TakuGaku?
* Allow users to filter completed assignments grades by class or assignment type.
* Test and Worksheet creator that will allow teachers to create a worksheet or test as an assignment that automatically grades the test/assignment upon completion.
* Resources page that has a list of outside resources such as worksheets, readings, and lesson plans for homeschooling.
